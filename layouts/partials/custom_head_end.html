{{/* Custom HTML head tag contents go here if it needs to be the very last thing within the head.
  This is useful for including stylesheets that need to override existing styles.

  If you are upgrading from a previous version, just add the following line
  to `layouts/partials/custom_head_end.html`:
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ `assets/custom_style.css` | relURL }}">
